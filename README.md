Implementation of Khan and Lin's [Conjugate-Computation Variational Inference: Converting Variational Inference in Non-Conjugate Models to Inferences in Conjugate Models
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04265) for linear dynamical systems w/ poisson likelihood.


# Getting Started
Before running our code, create a [conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html "Getting started with conda") environment using the file `environment.yml`. To do so, open a terminal and run:
```conda env create -f environment.yml```

Then, activate the created environment:
```source activate cvi-poisson-lds```

If you don't want to use conda, just make sure to use the libraries listed in `environment.yml` in their specified version. Additionally, the latest versions of Lasagna and Theano  are required to generate the data. They are not available on PyPI:

```bash
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/Theano/Theano/archive/master.zip
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne/archive/master.zip
```

## Running the Code
```bash
python cvi.py
```
Hyperparameters can be adjusted on lines 88 - 96. To use CVI for your own problem, write your own non-conjugate likelihood in _cvi\_helpers.non\_conjugate\_likelihood\(\)_.

## Plots
Plots are saved in CVI_PLDS/plots (see screenshot below). ![Fig](https://github.com/vmasrani/CVI_PLDS/plots/results_known_parameters.PNG "Figure 2 from the paper")
